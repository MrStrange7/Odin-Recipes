    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make the best butter chicken at home with this authentic Indian recipe. This Murgh Makhani is flavour packed, creamy,

        up the luxurious sauce.</p>

        <li>Meanwhile, combine cream, tomato sauce, remaining butter, salt, cayenne
            pepper, and garam masala in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a 
            simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>    
        <li>Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
